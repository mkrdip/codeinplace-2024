# Week 4 - Python Control Flow Notes

## Play the Game!

This week we developed a game using Python called `High-Low`, play it here:
https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/cip4/share/dSz1kgKuNdcHCV5ZjvEQ. 

## Review Control Flow

In week 1, we introduced Control Flow which is important to solve this week's problem, please review Week 1's note here [`week1/week1-notes.md`](week1/week1-notes.md). 

## Python Module
- We imported the `random` module in our program to generate random numbers. It is a built-in module of Python.
- You can see the code behind it here: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.12/Lib/random.py.
- You also can use UIUC's guide on Python's `random` module here to learn more: [Exploring the Wonders of Python's 'random' Library
](https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/guides/Random-library/Exploring%20the%20Wonders%20of%20Python's%20random%20Library/).
- Some interesting articles on random number generators: 
  - [Can a computer generate a truly random number?](https://engineering.mit.edu/engage/ask-an-engineer/can-a-computer-generate-a-truly-random-number/)
  - [The Complete Guide to Casino Random Number Generators](https://casino.betmgm.com/en/blog/understanding-random-number-generators-at-casinos/)
  - [Official Documentation on Python's `random` Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)

## Improve Code w/ Decomposition
Our solution was one huge code block in the `main` function, we can decompose it further, make it look nicer, easier to read and maintain using functions, and adding more clear comments. AA improved version is added here: [`/week4/high_low_improved.py`](/week4/high_low_improved.py). 

## Final Project
During class, some of the students mentioned about the final project. The staff hasn't posted anything about it but I showed you, how to use the forum to find information about projects from past years. I'd ask the professors to post more about the final project ASAP, so you can start early and also ask to assign volunteer section leaders like me who are willing to post sample/example projects.
